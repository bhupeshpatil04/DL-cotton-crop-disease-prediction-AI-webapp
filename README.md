🌱 Cotton Crop Disease Prediction Web Application

This project is a Deep Learning–based web application designed to predict cotton crop diseases from leaf images. The application helps farmers and agricultural stakeholders identify diseases at an early stage and take proactive measures to prevent large-scale crop damage.

The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of cotton leaf images representing healthy and diseased crops. The trained model analyzes input images and predicts the disease class with high accuracy. The system is integrated into a user-friendly web interface that allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions.
